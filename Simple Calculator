Headline: Day 1/30: Back to Basics – The Foundation of Logic 🚀

Body: Today marks Day 1 of my #30DaysOfPython challenge! I’m starting from the ground up to ensure my foundation for Business Analytics is rock solid.

Today’s Project: A precision-based calculator designed to handle decimal inputs.

Why this matters for Analytics:

Data Types Matter: I used float() instead of int(). In the world of finance and data, losing those decimal points means losing money.

Conditional Logic: Using the if-elif-else structure is the "brain" of any automated system. It allows the program to navigate through different business rules based on user input.

Error Handling: The else statement at the end serves as a basic validation tool to handle "dirty data" or invalid inputs.

Consistency is key, and I’m excited to see how these simple logic blocks evolve into complex data models over the next 29 days!
